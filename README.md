My Project is website that let's you hire people to do the chores that you are too lazy to do.
A user can sign up either as a customer or a worker for hire. We all have daily and weekly responsibilities and sometimes a little help with the errands can make your week less stressed.

## How to use the site:
* Create an account (either worker or customer).

* Click the 'Customers' tab to browse all customer profiles. Click the 'Workers' tab to browse all worker profiles.

* Go to your profile to delete your account. All orders associated with your account will be removed when you delete your account.

* Edit your profile by navigating to your profile page and clicking the edit button.

* For customers, place an order by navigating to your profile page and clicking the 'place order button'. Then fill out the appropriate information with a chore, and the worker you want to hire.

* Logout out of your account by clicking on the 'logout' button at the top of the screen.
